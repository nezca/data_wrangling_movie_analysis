** In this repository **

There are five steps Jupyter notebook to do data wrangling. 
It has been divided into two languages which are R and Julia. 
When users use these files on Jupyter Lab, just follow the numeric steps from 1 to 5. 
Then 4 CSV files will be created during the following steps. 
Before users start following the given steps using Jupyter notebooks.
The below files should be collected to start properly.


** The components of the files **

1. Introduction
README.txt				← Description of this repository

2. Jupyter notebooks
project_step_1(web_scrap)_R.ipynb		← Jupyter Lab notbook file_1
project_step_2(data_wrangle)_Julia.ipynb		← Jupyter Lab notbook file_2
project_step_3(data_analysing)_R.ipynb		← Jupyter Lab notbook file_3
project_step_4(data_wrangle)_Julia.ipynb		← Jupyter Lab notbook file_4
project_step_5(plotting)_Julia.ipynb		← Jupyter Lab notbook file_5

3. Tidy dataset for results
movie_data_step_final(tidyversion).csv		← The result file for tidy version
movie_data_step_final.csv			← The result file for plotting version

4. DATA422 Project dataset documentation.docx 	← definition for movie_data_step_final(tidyversion).csv

5. Data files to follow the all Jupyter notebook steps
movies_df_1_900.csv 				← The result CSV file for API stage in the Jupyter notebook
movies_df_900_1800.csv 			← The result CSV file for API stage in the Jupyter notebook
movies_df_1800_2000.csv 			← The result CSV file for API stage in the Jupyter notebook
movies_df_2000_2900.csv 			← The result CSV file for API stage in the Jupyter notebook
movies_df_2900_3890.csv 			← The result CSV file for API stage in the Jupyter notebook
movies_df_3890_4880.csv 			← The result CSV file for API stage in the Jupyter notebook
movies_df_4880_5800.csv (no data in this repo)	← This data will be created during the following steps
movies_df_by_year.csv			← The result CSV file for delimiting ":" using Excel.
